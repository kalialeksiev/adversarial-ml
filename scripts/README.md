# Scripts folder readme

This folder is for executable scripts, for usage from the command line. Examples include: model training, model testing, data cleaning, etc. See the `feature` folder for data cleaning scripts.

The directory nn_models includes a couple of implementations of neural networks. The script `vanilla_nn` includes a function which automatically creates and trains neural networks with certain degrees 
of freedom and hence can be used for experimentation. The `conv_nn` script includes an implementation of a convolutional neural network.

The directory model_weights is used to save pre-trained models.
