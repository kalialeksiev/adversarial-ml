# Scripts folder readme

This folder is for executable scripts, for usage from the command line. Examples include: model training, model testing, data cleaning, etc. See the `feature` folder for data cleaning scripts.

To find the code for building the models, see the `models` folder. Model weights should be saved in the `data` folder, ideally.
